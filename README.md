Board Trails
============

Simple app to gather whiteboard data for Lean-Agile teams and then report it - ideally producing charts and so on in a simple way... so people are not forced to use heavyweight electronic tools when they want to create big visible boards instead.

Measurements that this app will be interested in include:
* Average Completion Rate (disambiguation of cycle time)
* WIP
* Defect rate of work items on the physical board (but not the defects themselves)

To calculate:
* Potential lead time for any items added to the board


Getting started on the code base
--------------------------------

boardtrails.rb is the main Sinatra app file and everything starts there.
